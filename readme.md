## Inspiration

The inspiration and the goal to deliver its a similar way of handling node modules
but off course not losing the simplicity of the python programing language, taking
into consideration the difference in use cases between both programming languages.

I know that the name its wrong but mmp was taken by the time that i build this
solution.

## Quickstart

### Installation

##### Requirements

Python 3.6+

* [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for the envs
* [docopt](http://docopt.org/) for command handling and docs

To install mmp:

```bash
$ pip3 install mmp
```

### First commands

For installing modules into your project

```bash
$ mmp install [module_name]
```

This is how you run your scripts.

```bash
$ mmp run my_perfect_script.py
```

**by the way** if your script file name is run.py run this instead.

```bash
$ mmp run
```

### Help

If you need help, just add -h to whatever you want to know about

```bash
$ mmp -h
$ mmp run -h
```
