[![Python 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3)

This is a cli solution for an easier and faster way to handle you python modules
with your projects.

## Inspiration

The inspiration and the goal to deliver its a similar way of handling node modules
but off course not losing the simplicity of the python programing language, taking
into consideration the difference in use cases between both programming languages.

## Quickstart

To start using mpip, first install the program, at this early stages we just have
the installation by pip so its required for you to have that also the app just works
with python 3 and up so you need to use pip3 in the case that you have python 2 as
your default python version.

```bash
$ pip3 install mpip
```
